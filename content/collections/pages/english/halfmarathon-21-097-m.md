        text: 'The first part of the route is fast, as the roads are flat and wide. The first 6.5km runs together with runners on the 6.5km run and 10km run. The second part is a bit more varied, but much nicer because the route will run along the river Krka and cross some of the most beautiful running places in the Novo mesto.'
