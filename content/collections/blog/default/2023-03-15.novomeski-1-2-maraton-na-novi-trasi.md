        text: 'Due to the planned renovation of the wooden bridge in Loke, we have changed the route of the half marathon this year. The new route is going through new Novo mesto bridge designed by famous architect Marjan Pipenbaher. The route is running along the river Krka in the direction of city Straža. Route is flat and even faster than in previous years. The half marathon is officialy measured. As a result, shorter race courses have been changed, which will be completely new. The 5km route will be officially measured and will be in one lap, while the 10km route will follow the same route as the 5km, except that it will be in two laps. All routes will be officially measured.'
